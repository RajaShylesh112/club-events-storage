# üìù How to Write a Debug Report

When stuck, capture these six things in the report. Keep it short, but clear:

1. **Context**
   - What environment am I running? (language, framework, OS, versions if needed)

2. **Expected vs Actual**
   - What did I expect to happen?  
   - What actually happened?

3. **Steps to Reproduce**
   - Minimal steps that trigger the bug (1-2 lines is enough).

4. **Logs / Error Output**
   - Copy the *first meaningful error* or weird output.  
   - Skip irrelevant noise.

5. **Hypothesis / Notes**
   - My guess about the cause.  
   - Fixes or workarounds already tried.

6. **Question / Goal**
   - What do I need solved or clarified? (be specific)

---

‚ö° Rule of thumb: *enough info so someone else (or future-me) could reproduce and reason about the bug without extra digging.*
